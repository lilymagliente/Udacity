This project is for Udacity. The data was downloaded from Kaggle and outlined Seattle's Air BnBs.Libraries included, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, IPython, datetime, seaborn and sklearn. 

The Seattle dataset is large but once closely evaluated, it unveils information and patterns about hosts and their air bnb listings. The right model will also give insight on the data in a way anyone can understand. 

There are three datasets. Calendar, which is a dataset with each listing and its availability. Listings, which is each listing and defining characterstics about the listing and the host. Reviews contains all reviews left on the air bnbs listed in listings. 

To increase one's overall rating, their other ratings are directly correlated. So to have a high rating, a host must make sure their descriptions of their listing is accurate in order to improve accuracy score. Additionally, they must make sure their place is clean to improve their accuracy score. Also, a host should look at when people visit the area, for example, if there is a time when not many people visit, the host can lower the listing price to draw people into their place so they are more likely to choose that place, because the market is more competitive.
