Are you looking to become an Air BnB host or are you already a host and are looking for ways to improve your ratings? The data proves that cleanliness, review scores accuracy, review scores communication, review scores check in and review scores location are all highly correlated with the overall score. Evidently, the other scores in this dataset are correlated to the overall score, but there also seems to be some correlation with square feet and the host's response rate. 
The r^2 outputted when predicting the ratings using the parameters with the top six correlation scores explains almost 65% of the variability. 
If one wants to improve their score, then they need to focus on improving the individual scores, like cleanliness or overall accuracy. 
How to maximize revenue? The data shows that these listings are available more often than they are booked throughout the entire year. Additionally, the bookings are much higher in March and December, which would make sense because that's when schools give students off for winter and spring break, respectively, so families might be more likely to go on vacation at that time, which could explain the spike. As a host, you could increase the rent just a little bit during these months, but not too much, because then you would maximize your profit but need to be cautious to still make it affordable enough so people still rent. 
Does this have any implication of the future of travelling? It shows that there were many more bookings in 2016 than 2017 but this could be an error in the data. This could also mean that less people are travelling to Seattle, but ultimately, we need more data to be able to make a clearer decision.
